Known Bugs
----
If you download this project be sure to also download the [Parse SDK for iOS](https://parse.com/downloads/ios/parse-library/latest) and replace the Parse framework in this project. Xcode doesn't completely upload the Parse framework and leaves out a few files causing the build errors.
